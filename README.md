# KnockOff
 Is a repository for a game demo that I'm currently working on called KnockOff. KnockOff is a 2 player game that can be played using a sinle keyboard. The main objective is to push the enemy player out of platform. There are buff&debuffs that randomly spawn during the battle. Maybe I could add more maps.
